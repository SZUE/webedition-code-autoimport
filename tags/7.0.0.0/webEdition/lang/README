Important informations for webEdition translators:
------------------------------------------------------------

The directory
   webEdition/lang/
contains tmx files (xml) with all language files used in
the webEdition SDK. The language directory names are
2-character ISO 3166-2 language codes, for example:
   webEdition/lang/de/
   webEdition/lang/fi/

The other language files of webEdition are located in
   webEdition/we/include/we_language/
and have the language names as they have been used in all
the previous webEdition versions, for example:
   webEdition/we/include/we_language/English_UTF-8
   webEdition/we/include/we_language/Dutch_UTF-8

IMPORTANT:

Please note that starting with webEdition 6 ALL LANGUAGE
FILES ARE UTF-8 ENCODED! This goes for the language files
in we_languages as well as for the new tmx files.
